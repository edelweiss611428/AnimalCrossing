Description: 
    A sample R package demonstrating how C++ classes defined using
    'Rcpp' Modules can be exposed to R and used polymorphically from
    both C++ and R. The package illustrates how multiple C++ classes
    deriving from a common base type can be passed to C++ functions
    through a shared interface, as well as how R-defined objects can
    be mapped to the same C++ base class via callback methods.
    This provides a minimal example of integrating object-oriented
    C++ code with R while preserving type safety and extensibility.
